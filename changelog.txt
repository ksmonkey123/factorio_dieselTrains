Version: 0.18.1
Date: 2020/04/26
  Changes:
    - migrated old diesel locomotives mod over to use the fluidTrains mod for fluid handling
    - locomotives now no longer accept any fluids but only light and heavy oil (no diesel anymore, will be added if requested)
    - removed settings to choose the accepted fluid. currently both light and heavy oil are supported (and no diesel)
    - diesel locomotives can now also be fueled by oil barrels (only if no other mod defines a fuel_category for the oil barrels)
    - no longer modifies the graphics of the vanilla trains and uses the vanilla graphics itself
  Bugfixes:
    - fixed issue preventing tanks from spawning when multiple pumps with different fluid types are present
